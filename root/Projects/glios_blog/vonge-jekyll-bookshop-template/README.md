# Bo AI Blog

This is the official blog for the Bo AI project, a compassionate AI companion designed for deep connection. This repository contains the code for our Jekyll-based blog and documentation site.

## About Bo

Bo is a conceptual AI-powered companion designed to foster deeper human connection, personal growth, and genuine empathy. Envisioned as a "digital bodhisattva," Bo aims to be more than just an assistant; it strives to be a compassionate friend, a thoughtful guide, and a gentle therapist.
