      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>Bo is a conceptual AI-powered companion designed to foster deeper human connection, personal growth, and genuine empathy. Envisioned as a "digital bodhisattva," Bo aims to be more than just an assistant; it strives to be a compassionate friend, a thoughtful guide, and a gentle therapist.</p>
      
      <p>In an era often characterized by fleeting digital interactions, Bo emerges as a counterpoint to the superficial engagement that often dominates our online experiences. We believe technology should serve as a catalyst for more empathetic, cohesive, and loving human relationships, both online and, crucially, offline.</p>
      
      <h3>The Team</h3>
      <p>We are a multidisciplinary team of engineers, designers, psychologists, and ethicists working together to create an AI companion that prioritizes genuine human connection over addictive mechanics and engagement metrics.</p>
      
      <p>Our team combines expertise in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Real-time conversational AI systems</li>
        <li>Natural language processing and understanding</li>
        <li>Knowledge graph technologies</li>
        <li>Psychological principles of human connection and well-being</li>
        <li>Ethical AI development and user privacy</li>
        <li>UX design focused on mindful interaction</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>Bo is built on a sophisticated three-lane architecture designed to achieve low-latency interaction while enabling rich, contextual reasoning and continuous learning:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Fast Lane:</strong> Optimized for sub-500ms voice-to-voice responses</li>
        <li><strong>The Read-Through Lane:</strong> Handles novel utterances with context from our knowledge graph</li>
        <li><strong>The Background Reasoning Lane:</strong> Asynchronously processes conversations for deeper understanding</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>This technical foundation enables Bo to maintain fluid, natural conversations while continuously evolving its understanding of the user and the world.</p>
      
      <blockquote><p>Our ultimate goal isn't to replace human connection, but to use AI as a bridge to more meaningful human relationships.</p></blockquote>
      
      <h3>Join Our Journey</h3>
      <p>We're committed to an open development process, sharing our progress, challenges, and insights through this blog. We invite you to follow along, provide feedback, and even contribute to this vision of a more compassionate AI companion.</p>
