The Bo AI MVP focuses on delivering a highly responsive, voice-first conversational experience with low-latency interactions. Our primary goal is to create an AI companion that feels natural and responsive, capable of genuine-seeming empathy and contextual awareness.

## Core Components

Our MVP development is centered around three critical components:

1. **Three-Lane Architecture** - A novel system design that balances immediate responsiveness with deep reasoning capabilities by separating processing into parallel pathways:
   - Fast Lane: Sub-500ms responses using cached patterns
   - Read-Through Lane: Context-aware responses using knowledge graph
   - Background Reasoning Lane: Asynchronous deep learning and reasoning

2. **Voice-First Experience** - Utilizing cutting-edge speech technologies:
   - Deepgram Nova-3 for ultra-low latency speech-to-text
   - OpenAI GPT-4o Realtime for expressive text-to-speech
   - LiveKit for real-time audio streaming

3. **Contextual Memory System** - Multi-layered approach to remembering user details and conversation history:
   - Redis SemanticCache for microsecond-latency working memory
   - Neo4j/Graphiti knowledge graph for structured conversation context
   - LightRAG for deep, long-term memory and pattern recognition

## Development Timeline

The Bo MVP is scheduled for completion by Q3 2025, with our 12-week development plan divided into three phases:

- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Core Voice & Caching Pipeline
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)**: Knowledge Graph & Basic Reasoning
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)**: Full Loop Integration, UX Refinements & Testing

The MVP will focus on the onboarding experience and basic rapport-building capabilities, demonstrating Bo's ability to engage in natural conversation while remembering key details about the user. Post-MVP, we'll expand into deeper growth-oriented interactions and community features.
